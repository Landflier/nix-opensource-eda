# Nix Project Setup for EDA Tools on Ubuntu
_Exported on 5/29/2025 at 00:31:39 GMT+3 from Cursor (0.50.5)_

---

**User**

I would like to setup a project for Ubuntu 22.04, which contains Nix derivations for Magic VLSI, Netgen, Yosys, OpenROAD, KLayout, open_pdks, NGspice.  I would like the project to be structured with a folder for each of the packages, which are to contain the nix derivations. Then I want to be able with a simple command to install these derivations on the Ubuntu 22.04 machine.

---

**Cursor**

I'll help you set up a Nix project for these EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tools. I'll create a structured project with individual derivations for each tool and a way to install them easily.

First, let me create the basic project structure.


---

**User**

please proceed

**Cursor**

I'll proceed with creating the project structure and setting up the necessary Nix files. Let me first create the basic project structure and then we'll implement each package derivation.


Now I'll create the main `default.nix` file that will serve as the entry point for our package collection:


```plaintext
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

let
  inherit (pkgs) lib;

  # Import individual package derivations
  magic-vlsi = import ./pkgs/magic-vlsi { inherit pkgs; };
  netgen = import ./pkgs/netgen { inherit pkgs; };
  yosys = import ./pkgs/yosys { inherit pkgs; };
  openroad = import ./pkgs/openroad { inherit pkgs; };
  klayout = import ./pkgs/klayout { inherit pkgs; };
  open_pdks = import ./pkgs/open_pdks { inherit pkgs; };
  ngspice = import ./pkgs/ngspice { inherit pkgs; };

in {
  inherit magic-vlsi netgen yosys openroad klayout open_pdks ngspice;

  # Create a combined package with all tools
  all = pkgs.buildEnv {
    name = "eda-tools";
    paths = [
      magic-vlsi
      netgen
      yosys
      openroad
      klayout
      open_pdks
      ngspice
    ];
  };
}
```

Now, let's create a `shell.nix` file that will provide a development environment with all the tools:


```plaintext
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

let
  eda-tools = import ./default.nix { inherit pkgs; };
in
  pkgs.mkShell {
    buildInputs = [
      eda-tools.all
    ];

    shellHook = ''
      echo "EDA Tools Development Environment"
      echo "Available tools:"
      echo "  - Magic VLSI"
      echo "  - Netgen"
      echo "  - Yosys"
      echo "  - OpenROAD"
      echo "  - KLayout"
      echo "  - Open PDKs"
      echo "  - NGspice"
    '';
  }
```

Now, let's create the individual package derivations. I'll start with Magic VLSI:


```plaintext
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation {
  pname = "magic-vlsi";
  version = "8.3.463";

  src = pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {
    owner = "RTimothyEdwards";
    repo = "magic";
    rev = "8.3.463";
    sha256 = "sha256-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"; # You'll need to update this
  };

  nativeBuildInputs = with pkgs; [
    autoconf
    automake

    pkg-config

I've created all the package derivations following the same style as the existing ones. Each package derivation includes:

1. Proper versioning and source fetching from GitHub
2. Required build dependencies (nativeBuildInputs and buildInputs)
3. Appropriate build configuration flags
4. Meta information including description, homepage, and license

Note that the `sha256` values are placeholders (marked with X's). When you try to build these packages, Nix will fail and provide the correct hash that you should use. You'll need to replace these placeholders with the actual hashes after the first build attempt.

To use these packages, you can:

1. Install all tools at once:
```bash
nix-env -if default.nix -A all
```

2. Install individual tools:
```bash
nix-env -if default.nix -A magic-vlsi
nix-env -if default.nix -A netgen
# etc...
```

3. Enter a development shell with all tools:
```bash
nix-shell
```

Would you like me to make any adjustments to any of the package derivations?

```shellscript
nix-env -if default.nix -A all
```

```shellscript
nix-env -if default.nix -A magic-vlsi
nix-env -if default.nix -A netgen
# etc...
```

```shellscript
nix-shell
```

**User**

Can i test if the derivations are working properly, without installing thme?

---

**Cursor**

Yes, you can test the derivations without installing them using Nix's build command. This will attempt to build the packages and show any errors without actually installing them. Here's how you can test them:


---

**User**

what do I need to install on ubuntu to use nix?

---

**Cursor**

To use Nix on Ubuntu 22.04, you'll need to install the Nix package manager first. Here's how to do it:


Now that Nix is installed, you'll need to restart your terminal session for the changes to take effect. After restarting your terminal, you can verify the installation by running:


It seems you need to restart your terminal session for the Nix installation to take effect. Please:

1. Close your current terminal
2. Open a new terminal
3. Navigate back to your project directory:
```bash
cd ~/Downloads/CAD_nix_setup
```

After doing this, you'll be able to use Nix commands and test the package derivations. Would you like me to help you test the derivations once you've restarted your terminal?

```shellscript
cd ~/Downloads/CAD_nix_setup
```

---

**User**

can you again show me how to test each derivation?

---

**Cursor**

Yes, I'll show you how to test each derivation individually. You can use `nix-build` to test each package without installing it. Here's how to test each one:


I see you still need to restart your terminal for the Nix installation to take effect. Once you've restarted your terminal, here are the commands to test each derivation:

1. Test Magic VLSI:
```bash
nix-build default.nix -A magic-vlsi
```

2. Test Netgen:
```bash
nix-build default.nix -A netgen
```

3. Test Yosys:
```bash
nix-build default.nix -A yosys
```

4. Test OpenROAD:
```bash
nix-build default.nix -A openroad
```

5. Test KLayout:
```bash
nix-build default.nix -A klayout
```

6. Test Open PDKs:
```bash
nix-build default.nix -A open_pdks
```

7. Test NGspice:
```bash
nix-build default.nix -A ngspice
```

8. Test all packages at once:
```bash
nix-build default.nix -A all
```

When you run these commands:
- If the build succeeds, it will create a `result` symlink in your current directory pointing to the built package
- If there are any errors, it will show you the build logs and error messages
- The first time you build each package, Nix will download the source code and dependencies

Please restart your terminal first, then try these commands. Would you like me to help you test them once you've restarted your terminal?

```shellscript
nix-build default.nix -A magic-vlsi
```

```shellscript
nix-build default.nix -A netgen
```

```shellscript
nix-build default.nix -A yosys
```

```shellscript
nix-build default.nix -A openroad
```

```shellscript
nix-build default.nix -A klayout
```

```shellscript
nix-build default.nix -A open_pdks
```

```shellscript
nix-build default.nix -A ngspice
```

```shellscript
nix-build default.nix -A all
```

**User**

why do I keep getting this error not a git repo?

---

**Cursor**

This error occurs because the Magic VLSI build process is trying to get the git commit hash, but the source code isn't being fetched as a git repository. We need to modify the Magic VLSI derivation to properly fetch the source code as a git repository.

Let me modify the Magic VLSI derivation:


```plaintext
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation {
  pname = "magic-vlsi";
  version = "8.3";

  src = pkgs.fetchgit {
    url = "https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/magic";
    rev = "8.3";
    sha256 = "sha256-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX";
    fetchSubmodules = true;
  };

  nativeBuildInputs = with pkgs; [
    autoconf
    automake
    libtool
    pkg-config
  ];

  buildInputs = with pkgs; [
    tcl
    tk
    xorg.libX11
    cairo
    mesa
    mesa_glu
  ];

  preConfigure = ''
    ./bootstrap
  '';

  meta = with pkgs.lib; {
    description = "VLSI layout tool";
    homepage = "http://opencircuitdesign.com/magic/";
    license = licenses.gpl2;
    platforms = platforms.linux;
  };
}
```

The key changes I made are:

1. Changed from `fetchFromGitHub` to `fetchgit` which properly clones the git repository
2. Added `fetchSubmodules = true` to ensure all git submodules are fetched
3. Added necessary build dependencies like `cairo`, `mesa`, and `mesa_glu`

Now when you try to build Magic VLSI, it should properly fetch the git repository and have access to the git information it needs. Try building it again with:

```bash
nix-build default.nix -A magic-vlsi
```

The first time you run this, it will fail with a hash mismatch error. This is normal - Nix will show you the correct hash to use. You'll need to copy that hash and replace the `sha256-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` in the derivation with the correct hash.

Would you like me to help you test it now?

```shellscript
nix-build default.nix -A magic-vlsi
```

**User**

how to get the sha256 hash? In nix, there is a command, something like nix-prefetch-git

---

**Cursor**

Yes, exactly! You can use `nix-prefetch-git` to get the correct SHA256 hash. Here's how to use it:


---

**User**

what is the error?

what is the error?

**Cursor**

The error is:
```
/nix/store/nivcx63drxqzm6pic6vm2wbkxl368w83-stdenv-linux/setup: line 269: ./bootstrap: No such file or directory
```

This means that the `bootstrap` script is not found in the source directory. Looking at the Magic VLSI repository, it seems we need to modify our derivation because the build process is different. Let me fix the Magic VLSI derivation:

    description = "VLSI layout tool";
    homepage = "http://opencircuitdesign.com/magic/";
    license = licenses.gpl2;
    platforms = platforms.linux;
  };
}
```

The main changes I made are:
1. Removed the `preConfigure` phase that was trying to run `bootstrap` (which doesn't exist)
2. Added proper `configureFlags` to specify the locations of Tcl/Tk libraries and X11 support

Now let's try to get the correct SHA256 hash:


---

**User**

and now?

---

**Cursor**

Now we have a new error:
```
./scripts/makedbh: cannot execute: required file not found
```

This is happening because the `makedbh` script needs to be made executable before it can be run. Let's modify the Magic VLSI derivation to fix this:


```plaintext
./scripts/makedbh: cannot execute: required file not found
```

```plaintext
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation {
  pname = "magic-vlsi";
  version = "8.3.525";

  src = pkgs.fetchgit {
    url = "https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/magic";
    rev = "8.3.525";
    sha256 = "sha256-yviA36C4KkGNM56rvZvPBi5huvKDO5Z4DG9gO5tKYCA=";
    fetchSubmodules = true;
  };

  nativeBuildInputs = with pkgs; [
    autoconf
    automake
    libtool
    pkg-config
  ];

  buildInputs = with pkgs; [
    tcl
    tk
    xorg.libX11
    cairo
    mesa
    mesa_glu
  ];

  configureFlags = [
    "--with-tcl=${pkgs.tcl}/lib"
    "--with-tk=${pkgs.tk}/lib"
    "--with-x"
  ];

  preBuild = ''
    chmod +x scripts/makedbh
  '';

  meta = with pkgs.lib; {
    description = "VLSI layout tool";
    homepage = "http://opencircuitdesign.com/magic/";
    license = licenses.gpl2;
    platforms = platforms.linux;
  };
}
```

I added a `preBuild` phase that makes the `makedbh` script executable before the build process starts. Try building it again with:

```bash
nix-build default.nix -A magic-vlsi
```

This should resolve the permission error. Let me know if you encounter any other issues!

```shellscript
nix-build default.nix -A magic-vlsi
```

```shellscript
nix-build default.nix -A magic-vlsi
```

**User**

the config cannot find python3

---

**Cursor**

Ah, we need to add Python3 to the build inputs since Magic VLSI uses it for some of its functionality. Let me modify the derivation:


```plaintext

I made two changes:
1. Added `python3` to the `buildInputs`
2. Added `--with-python` configure flag to explicitly tell the build system where to find Python3

Try building it again with:
```bash
nix-build default.nix -A magic-vlsi

This should resolve the Python3 detection issue. Let me know if you encounter any other problems!

Ah, we need to add `git` to the `nativeBuildInputs` since it's needed during the build process. Let me modify the derivation:


```plaintext

```

I added `git` to the `nativeBuildInputs`. Try building it again with:
```bash

This should resolve the git command not found error. Let me know if you encounter any other issues!

```shellscript

**User**

again the same error of "not a git repository"

---

**Cursor**

Ah, I see the issue now. The problem is that `fetchgit` removes the `.git` directory after fetching, but Magic's build process needs it to get the git commit hash. We need to modify the derivation to preserve the git information. Let's use `fetchFromGitHub` instead and add a `postUnpack` phase to initialize git:


```plaintext
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation {
  pname = "magic-vlsi";
  version = "8.3.525";

  src = pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {
    owner = "RTimothyEdwards";
    repo = "magic";
    rev = "8.3.525";
    sha256 = "sha256-yviA36C4KkGNM56rvZvPBi5huvKDO5Z4DG9gO5tKYCA=";
  };

  nativeBuildInputs = with pkgs; [
    autoconf

  buildInputs = with pkgs; [

    tk
    xorg.libX11
    cairo

    mesa_glu
    python3

  configureFlags = [
    "--with-tcl=${pkgs.tcl}/lib"
    "--with-tk=${pkgs.tk}/lib"
    "--with-x"
    "--with-python=${pkgs.python3}/bin/python3"
  ];

  postUnpack = ''
    cd $sourceRoot
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
  '';

  preBuild = ''
    chmod +x scripts/makedbh

  meta = with pkgs.lib; {
    description = "VLSI layout tool";
    homepage = "http://opencircuitdesign.com/magic/";
    license = licenses.gpl2;
    platforms = platforms.linux;
  };
}
```

The key changes are:
1. Changed from `fetchgit` to `fetchFromGitHub`
2. Added a `postUnpack` phase that initializes a git repository in the source directory
3. Removed `fetchSubmodules` as it's not needed with `fetchFromGitHub`

Try building it again with:
```bash
nix-build default.nix -A magic-vlsi
```

This should resolve the git repository error. Let me know if you encounter any other issues!

**User**

how to comment out stuff in .nix?

---

**Cursor**

In Nix files, you can use `#` for single-line comments and `/* */` for multi-line comments. Here are examples:

```nix
# This is a single-line comment

/* This is a
   multi-line
   comment */

{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation {
  # This is a comment explaining the pname
  pname = "magic-vlsi";
  
  /* This is a multi-line comment
     explaining the version number */
  version = "8.3.525";
  
  # ... rest of the file
}
```

Would you like me to help you comment out specific parts of your Nix files?

```plaintext
# This is a single-line comment

/* This is a
   multi-line
   comment */

{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation {
  # This is a comment explaining the pname
  pname = "magic-vlsi";
  
  /* This is a multi-line comment
     explaining the version number */
  version = "8.3.525";
  
  # ... rest of the file
}

**User**

now, how will Ubuntu know to use the package installed from nix? 

---

**Cursor**

When you install packages through Nix, they are installed in the Nix store (typically `/nix/store/`) and symlinked to your user profile. To make these packages available in your system, you have a few options:

1. **Using nix-env (User-level installation)**:
```bash
# Install all packages
nix-env -if default.nix -A all

# Or install individual packages
nix-env -if default.nix -A magic-vlsi
nix-env -if default.nix -A netgen
# etc...
```
This will make the packages available in your user's PATH.

2. **Using nix-shell (Temporary environment)**:
```bash
# Enter a shell with all packages
nix-shell

# Or enter a shell with specific packages
nix-shell -A magic-vlsi
```
This creates a temporary environment with the specified packages.

3. **Using nix profile (Modern approach)**:
```bash
# Install all packages
nix profile install -f default.nix all

# Or install individual packages
nix profile install -f default.nix magic-vlsi
```

4. **Create a system-wide installation** (requires root):
```bash
# Install to /etc/profile.d
sudo nix-env -if default.nix -A all
```

The most common approach is using `nix-env` or `nix profile`. After installation, you can verify the packages are available by running:
```bash
which magic
which netgen
which yosys
# etc...
```

Would you like me to help you set up any of these installation methods?

```shellscript
# Install all packages
nix-env -if default.nix -A all

# Or install individual packages
nix-env -if default.nix -A magic-vlsi
nix-env -if default.nix -A netgen
# etc...
```

```shellscript
# Enter a shell with all packages
nix-shell

# Or enter a shell with specific packages
nix-shell -A magic-vlsi
```

```shellscript
# Install all packages
nix profile install -f default.nix all

# Or install individual packages
nix profile install -f default.nix magic-vlsi
```

```shellscript
# Install to /etc/profile.d
sudo nix-env -if default.nix -A all
```

```shellscript
which magic
which netgen
which yosys
# etc...
```

I see the error - the `open_pdks/default.nix` file is empty. Let me create the proper derivation for open_pdks:


I apologize for the error in my tool usage. Let me explain what needs to be done:

The error occurs because the `open_pdks/default.nix` file is empty. You need to create a proper derivation for open_pdks. Here's what the file should contain:

```nix
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation {
  pname = "open_pdks";
  version = "1.0.480";

  src = pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {
    owner = "google";
    repo = "open_pdks";
    rev = "v1.0.480";
    sha256 = "sha256-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX";
  };

  nativeBuildInputs = with pkgs; [
    autoconf
    automake
    libtool
    pkg-config
  ];

  buildInputs = with pkgs; [
    magic-vlsi
  ];

  configureFlags = [
    "--enable-sky130-pdk"
    "--enable-gf180-pdk"
  ];

  meta = with pkgs.lib; {
    description = "Open Process Design Kits";
    homepage = "https://github.com/google/open_pdks";
    license = licenses.asl20;
    platforms = platforms.linux;
  };
}
```

You'll need to:
1. Create this file at `pkgs/open_pdks/default.nix`
2. Get the correct SHA256 hash using:
```bash
nix-prefetch-git https://github.com/google/open_pdks.git v1.0.480
```
3. Replace the placeholder SHA256 in the file with the actual hash

Would you like me to help you with any of these steps?

```plaintext
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation {
  pname = "open_pdks";

    platforms = platforms.linux;
  };
}
```

```shellscript
nix-prefetch-git https://github.com/google/open_pdks.git v1.0.480
```

I see the issue. The error occurs because the main `default.nix` is trying to import `./pkgs/open_pdks` but it's looking for `default.nix` while we have `open_pdks.nix`. We have two options:

1. Rename `open_pdks.nix` to `default.nix`
2. Update the import in the main `default.nix` to point to `open_pdks.nix`

Let's go with option 1 since it's more conventional in Nix. We need to:

1. Rename `pkgs/open_pdks/open_pdks.nix` to `pkgs/open_pdks/default.nix`
2. Get the SHA256 hash for the source

To get the SHA256 hash, run:
```bash
nix-prefetch-git https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/open_pdks.git 1.0.524
```

Then update the `sha256` field in the file with the hash you get.

Would you like me to help you with these steps?

```shellscript
nix-prefetch-git https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/open_pdks.git 1.0.524
```

**User**

can you edit open_pdks to have a similar structure as magic-vlsi (two files, etc etc)

---

**Cursor**

Yes, I'll help you restructure the open_pdks package to match the magic-vlsi structure with two files. We'll create:

1. `default.nix` - The main entry point
2. `open_pdks.nix` - The actual package derivation

First, let's create the main `default.nix`:


```plaintext
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

{
  open_pdks = pkgs.callPackage ./open_pdks.nix { };
}
```

Now, let's create the actual package derivation in `open_pdks.nix`:


```plaintext
{ lib
, stdenv
, fetchFromGitHub
, callPackage
, git
, wget
, curl
, gnused
, python3 
}:
 
stdenv.mkDerivation {
  pname = "open_pdks";
  version = "1.0.524";

  src = fetchFromGitHub {
    owner = "RTimothyEdwards";
    repo = "open_pdks";
    rev = "1.0.524";
    sha256 = "1x12ad3pwxdsdk6d7n7wi933rjr9isn8m7q67gpvmgvb2sp1cmcl";
  };

  nativeBuildInputs = with pkgs; [
    git
    wget
    curl
    gnused
    python3
  ];

  buildInputs = with pkgs; [
    magic-vlsi
  ];

  configureFlags = [
    "--enable-sky130-pdk"
    "--enable-gf180mcu-pdk"
    "--disable-io-sky130"
    "--disable-sc-hs-sky130"
    "--disable-sc-ms-sky130"
    "--disable-sc-ls-sky130"
    "--disable-sc-lp-sky130"
    "--disable-sc-hd-sky130"
    "--disable-sc-hdll-sky130"
    "--disable-sc-hvl-sky130"
    "--disable-alpha-sky130"
    "--disable-xschem-sky130"
    "--disable-klayout-sky130"
  ];

  meta = with lib; {
    description = "Open Process Design Kits";
    homepage = "https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/open_pdks";
    license = licenses.asl20;
    platforms = platforms.linux;
  };
}
```

I've restructured the open_pdks package to match the magic-vlsi structure:

1. `default.nix` is now a simple entry point that uses `callPackage` to call the actual derivation
2. `open_pdks.nix` contains the actual package derivation with all the build details

The main changes are:
- Split the package into two files
- Added proper version and pname
- Added meta information
- Moved build dependencies to appropriate categories (nativeBuildInputs vs buildInputs)
- Kept all the existing configuration flags

Try building it now with:
```bash
nix-build default.nix -A open_pdks
```

Let me know if you encounter any issues!

```shellscript
nix-build default.nix -A open_pdks
```

---

**User**

there is an error

---

**Cursor**

Ah yes, I see the error. The issue is that we're using `pkgs` in `open_pdks.nix` but it's not passed as an argument. Let's fix both files:

1. First, let's fix `default.nix`:


```plaintext
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

{
  open_pdks = pkgs.callPackage ./open_pdks.nix { inherit pkgs; };
}
```

2. Now, let's fix `open_pdks.nix`:


```plaintext
{ lib
, stdenv
, fetchFromGitHub
, callPackage
, git
, wget
, curl
, gnused
, python3
, pkgs
}:
 
stdenv.mkDerivation {

  };

  nativeBuildInputs = with pkgs; [
    git
    wget
    curl
    gnused
    python3
  ];

  buildInputs = with pkgs; [

    homepage = "https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/open_pdks";
    license = licenses.asl20;
    platforms = platforms.linux;
  };
}
```

The key changes are:
1. In `default.nix`, we now pass `pkgs` to the package using `inherit pkgs`
2. In `open_pdks.nix`, we added `pkgs` to the function arguments

Try building it again with:
```bash
nix-build default.nix -A open_pdks
```

This should resolve the "undefined variable 'pkgs'" error. Let me know if you encounter any other issues!

```shellscript
nix-build default.nix -A open_pdks
```

**User**

this is an error when configuring the open_pdk or no?

---

**Cursor**

Yes, this is an error during the build process of `open_pdks`. The specific error is that the build script cannot find and execute the `../scripts/download.sh` script, which is needed to download various PDK components. The error message appears multiple times:

```
/nix/store/xy4jjgw87sbgwylm5kn047d9gkbhsr9x-bash-5.2p37/bin/bash: line 9: ../scripts/download.sh: cannot execute: required file not found
```

This is happening because:
1. The build process is trying to download several PDK components (primitive libraries, verification libraries, standard cell libraries, etc.)
2. It's looking for a download script at `../scripts/download.sh` relative to the build directory
3. This script doesn't exist or isn't executable in the Nix build environment

To fix this, we need to:
1. Make sure the `scripts` directory is included in the source
2. Make the `download.sh` script executable
3. Ensure the script is available during the build phase

Let me modify the `open_pdks.nix` file to handle this:


```plaintext
/nix/store/xy4jjgw87sbgwylm5kn047d9gkbhsr9x-bash-5.2p37/bin/bash: line 9: ../scripts/download.sh: cannot execute: required file not found

}
```

I've added a `preBuild` phase that:
1. Makes the `download.sh` script executable with `chmod +x`
2. Creates the `sources` directory where the PDK components will be downloaded

Try building it again with:
```bash
nix-build default.nix -A open_pdks
```

If we still encounter issues, we might need to:
1. Check if the `download.sh` script exists in the source
2. Verify the script's contents and dependencies
3. Consider pre-downloading the PDK components and including them in the source

Let me know what happens with this change!

```shellscript
nix-build default.nix -A open_pdks
```

```shellscript
nix-build default.nix -A open_pdks
```

Looking at the error logs, I can see that the build process is failing because it can't find the `download.sh` script in the expected location. The error occurs during the build phase when trying to download various PDK components.

The key issues are:
1. The script is looking for `../scripts/download.sh` but can't find it
2. The error message is: `../scripts/download.sh: cannot execute: required file not found`

Let's modify the `open_pdks.nix` file to fix this by:
1. Creating the scripts directory
2. Creating the download script with the necessary content
3. Making it executable

I've updated the `preBuild` phase to:
1. Create a `scripts` directory
2. Create a simple `download.sh` script that can handle git cloning with or without a specific branch
3. Make the script executable
4. Create the `sources` directory

The script will:
- Take 3 arguments: repository URL, destination path, and optional branch name
- Use `git clone` to download the repositories
- Handle both cases where a branch is specified or not

Try building it again with:
```bash
nix-build default.nix -A open_pdks
```

This should resolve the "cannot execute: required file not found" error. Let me know if you encounter any other issues!

```shellscript
nix-build default.nix -A open_pdks

i am guessing the error is since we do not download all submodules from git

---

**Cursor**

Ah yes, you're right! The issue is that we need to fetch the git submodules as well. Let's modify the `open_pdks.nix` file to properly handle git submodules:


```plaintext
{ lib
, stdenv
, fetchFromGitHub
, callPackage
, git
, wget
, curl
, gnused
, python3
, pkgs
}:
 
stdenv.mkDerivation {
  pname = "open_pdks";
  version = "1.0.524";

  src = fetchFromGitHub {
    owner = "RTimothyEdwards";
    repo = "open_pdks";
    rev = "1.0.524";
    sha256 = "1x12ad3pwxdsdk6d7n7wi933rjr9isn8m7q67gpvmgvb2sp1cmcl";
    fetchSubmodules = true;
  };

  nativeBuildInputs = with pkgs; [
    git
    wget
    curl
    gnused
    python3
  ];

  buildInputs = with pkgs; [
    magic-vlsi
  ];

  postUnpack = ''
    cd $sourceRoot
    git init
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
  '';

  configureFlags = [
    "--enable-sky130-pdk"
    "--enable-gf180mcu-pdk"
    "--disable-sc-7t5v0-gf180mcu"
    "--disable-sc-9t5v0-gf180mcu"
    "--disable-io-sky130"
    "--disable-sc-hs-sky130"
    "--disable-sc-ms-sky130"
    "--disable-sc-ls-sky130"
    "--disable-sc-lp-sky130"
    "--disable-sc-hd-sky130"
    "--disable-sc-hdll-sky130"
    "--disable-sc-hvl-sky130"
    "--disable-alpha-sky130"
    "--disable-xschem-sky130"
    "--disable-klayout-sky130"
  ];

  meta = with lib; {
    description = "Open Process Design Kits";
    homepage = "https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/open_pdks";
    license = licenses.asl20;
    platforms = platforms.linux;
  };
}
```

I've made two key changes:
1. Added `fetchSubmodules = true` to the `fetchFromGitHub` call to ensure submodules are fetched
2. Added a `postUnpack` phase that:
   - Changes to the source root directory
   - Initializes git
   - Initializes submodules
   - Updates submodules

This should properly handle the git submodules that open_pdks needs. Try building it again with:
```bash
nix-build default.nix -A open_pdks
```

The error should be resolved now since we're properly handling the git submodules. Let me know if you encounter any other issues!

```shellscript
nix-build default.nix -A open_pdks
```

the git branch is not a good solution, since we are initing an empty git. instead, is it possible to keep the .git from the original github fetch

---

**Cursor**

Ah yes, you're absolutely right! Instead of initializing a new git repository, we should preserve the `.git` directory from the original fetch. Let's modify the `open_pdks.nix` file to use `fetchgit` instead of `fetchFromGitHub` since it preserves the git history:


```plaintext
{ lib
, stdenv
, fetchgit
, callPackage
, git
, wget
, curl
, gnused
, python3
, pkgs
}:
 
stdenv.mkDerivation {
  pname = "open_pdks";
  version = "1.0.524";

  src = fetchgit {
    url = "https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/open_pdks";
    rev = "1.0.524";
    sha256 = "1x12ad3pwxdsdk6d7n7wi933rjr9isn8m7q67gpvmgvb2sp1cmcl";
    fetchSubmodules = true;
  };

  nativeBuildInputs = with pkgs; [
    git
    wget
    curl
    gnused
    python3
  ];

  buildInputs = with pkgs; [
    magic-vlsi
  ];

  configureFlags = [
    "--enable-sky130-pdk"
    "--enable-gf180mcu-pdk"
    "--disable-sc-7t5v0-gf180mcu"
    "--disable-sc-9t5v0-gf180mcu"
    "--disable-io-sky130"
    "--disable-sc-hs-sky130"
    "--disable-sc-ms-sky130"
    "--disable-sc-ls-sky130"
    "--disable-sc-lp-sky130"
    "--disable-sc-hd-sky130"
    "--disable-sc-hdll-sky130"
    "--disable-sc-hvl-sky130"
    "--disable-alpha-sky130"
    "--disable-xschem-sky130"
    "--disable-klayout-sky130"
  ];

  meta = with lib; {
    description = "Open Process Design Kits";
    homepage = "https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/open_pdks";
    license = licenses.asl20;
    platforms = platforms.linux;
  };
}
```

The key changes are:
1. Switched from `fetchFromGitHub` to `fetchgit`
2. Removed the `postUnpack` phase since we don't need to initialize git anymore
3. Changed the source URL format to match `fetchgit`'s requirements

`fetchgit` will preserve the `.git` directory and submodules, which should allow the build process to access the git information it needs. Try building it again with:
```bash
nix-build default.nix -A open_pdks
```

This should work better since we're maintaining the original git repository structure. Let me know if you encounter any other issues!

```shellscript
nix-build default.nix -A open_pdks
```

**User**

we are trying to disable this

Ah, I see the issue. The `fetchgit` function is still removing the `.git` directory after fetching. Let's try a different approach by using `fetchFromGitHub` with `leaveDotGit = true`:


```plaintext
{ lib
, stdenv
, fetchFromGitHub
, callPackage
, git
, wget
, curl
, gnused
, python3
, pkgs
}:
 
stdenv.mkDerivation {
  pname = "open_pdks";
  version = "1.0.524";

  src = fetchFromGitHub {
    owner = "RTimothyEdwards";
    repo = "open_pdks";
    rev = "1.0.524";
    sha256 = "1x12ad3pwxdsdk6d7n7wi933rjr9isn8m7q67gpvmgvb2sp1cmcl";
    fetchSubmodules = true;
    leaveDotGit = true;
  };

  nativeBuildInputs = with pkgs; [
    git
    wget
    curl
    gnused
    python3
  ];

  buildInputs = with pkgs; [
    magic-vlsi
  ];

  configureFlags = [
    "--enable-sky130-pdk"
    "--enable-gf180mcu-pdk"
    "--disable-sc-7t5v0-gf180mcu"
    "--disable-sc-9t5v0-gf180mcu"
    "--disable-io-sky130"
    "--disable-sc-hs-sky130"
    "--disable-sc-ms-sky130"
    "--disable-sc-ls-sky130"
    "--disable-sc-lp-sky130"
    "--disable-sc-hd-sky130"
    "--disable-sc-hdll-sky130"
    "--disable-sc-hvl-sky130"
    "--disable-alpha-sky130"
    "--disable-xschem-sky130"
    "--disable-klayout-sky130"
  ];

  meta = with lib; {
    description = "Open Process Design Kits";
    homepage = "https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/open_pdks";
    license = licenses.asl20;
    platforms = platforms.linux;
  };
}
```

The key change is adding `leaveDotGit = true` to the `fetchFromGitHub` call. This should prevent the `.git` directory from being removed after fetching. Try building it again with:
```bash
nix-build default.nix -A open_pdks
```

This should preserve the git repository information that the build process needs. Let me know if you encounter any other issues!

```shellscript
nix-build default.nix -A open_pdks
```

Ah, I see the issue. The error is coming from the `magic-vlsi` package's `default.nix` file, not from `open_pdks`. The error message indicates a syntax error in `pkgs/magic-vlsi/default.nix` around line 40, specifically with the `preBuild` attribute.

Let me check the `magic-vlsi` package:


I see the issue now. There's a missing closing bracket `]` after the `configureFlags` list. Let me fix that:


```plaintext
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation {
  pname = "magic-vlsi";
  version = "8.3.525";

  src = pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {
    owner = "RTimothyEdwards";
    repo = "magic";
    rev = "8.3.525";
    sha256 = "sha256-yviA36C4KkGNM56rvZvPBi5huvKDO5Z4DG9gO5tKYCA=";
    leaveDotGit = true;
  };

  nativeBuildInputs = with pkgs; [
    autoconf
    automake
    libtool
    pkg-config
    git
  ];

  buildInputs = with pkgs; [
    tcl
    tk
    xorg.libX11
    cairo
    mesa
    mesa_glu
    python3
  ];

  configureFlags = [
    "--with-tcl=${pkgs.tcl}/lib"
    "--with-tk=${pkgs.tk}/lib"
    "--with-x"
    "--with-python=${pkgs.python3}/bin/python3"
  ];

  preBuild = ''
    chmod +x scripts/makedbh
  '';

  meta = with pkgs.lib; {
    description = "VLSI layout tool";
    homepage = "http://opencircuitdesign.com/magic/";
    license = licenses.gpl2;
    platforms = platforms.linux;
  };
}
```

I've fixed the syntax error by adding the missing `];` after the `configureFlags` list. Try building it again with:
```bash
nix-build default.nix -A magic-vlsi
```

This should resolve the syntax error. Let me know if you encounter any other issues!

```shellscript
nix-build default.nix -A magic-vlsi
```
